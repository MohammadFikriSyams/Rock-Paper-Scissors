    In this project, I explore how we can use CNN and transfer learning to build an image classifier. <br>The dataset consists of 2188 images that classified by <strong>Rock<strong>, <strong>Paper<strong>, and <strong>Scissors<strong>.

## File Descriptions

There are only 3 important files in this repository.
- `modelling.ipynb` is a jupyter notebook which can be run on Google Colab (with GPU for faster training. It contains step-by-step on how to create the image classifier and export the model. 
- `model_inception_weights.h5` is the trained weights of our deep learning model's layers. This is used to load the model in our web app.
- `apps.py` is the python file to deploy our web app in Streamlit.



## How to Use

To run the project locally, you can download this repo and type 

```
streamlit run apps.py
```

## Model Description

The foundational model that we use is Inception-V3 from Keras' pretrained models. However, we cut it off until 'mixed7' layer, and then add our own layers.

## Model Evaluation

We achieved 99% accuracy on training set and 97,5% accuracy on validation set.
